## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- Node.js - `v18.20.8` or `v20.3.0`, `v22.0.0` or higher. (`v19` and `v21` are not supported.)
- Terminal - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).
- Git - For version control and collaboration (Verify installation: `git --version`)

### Initial Setup

**1. Fork and Clone the Repository**

```bash
# clone your forked repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/osw-website
cd osw-website

# setup remote upstream 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/oscfcommunity/osw-website
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

Make sure to do `git checkout main` and `git pull origin main` to avoid conflicts.

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Create a new branch from the latest `develop`**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**2. Make Your Changes**

Write clean, well-documented code that follows project standards and includes meaningful comments, then test thoroughly by running the development server to verify all functionality works as expected. Ensure responsive design works across mobile and desktop devices, and always build successfully with `npm run build` before submitting.

**3. Test Comprehensively**

Run local testing with `npm run dev` and production builds using `npm run build` && `npm run preview` to verify functionality in both environments. Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and various screen sizes to ensure consistent appearance and behavior.

**4. Commit Your Work**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
```

**5. Push and Create Pull Request**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**Note** : Before starting to work on any issues, be sure to do `git checkout main` and `git pull origin main` to avoid conflicts.

## Guidelines

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

- **Features**: `feature/add-speaker-section`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/navigation-responsive-issue`
- **Documentation**: `docs/update-contributing-guide`
- **Styling**: `style/improve-mobile-layout`
- **Components**: `component/create-event-card`

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Write clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.**

**Format:**

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features (`feat(speakers): add speaker bio modal`)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (`fix(navigation): resolve mobile menu overlap`)
- `docs`: Documentation (`docs: update installation guide`)
- `style`: Code formatting (`style(components): fix indentation`)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (`refactor(utils): simplify date helpers`)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (`perf(images): optimize loading`)
- `test`: Adding tests (`test(auth): add login validation tests`)
- `build`: Build system changes (`build: update webpack config`)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes (`ci: add automated testing`)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (`chore: update dependencies`)

**Code Style**

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns and structure
- Ensure all builds pass without warnings
- Test responsive design on multiple devices
